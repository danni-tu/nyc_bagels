Over 13 months during the pandemic, the duo at Highley Varlet scored 200+ bagels from 1 to 5 in three categories: Bagel, Store, and Cream Cheese.

Bagels were also described using 8 characteristics:

- **Bagel features** (cracklyness/chewyness, size, topping density, salt level)
- **Cream cheese features** (fine/coarse scallions, dairy-forward/dairy-latent)
- **Store features** (contemporary/classic, variety of offerings)

and all 5 boroughs of New York City were represented. 

## Are Bagel Characteristics Predictive of Score?

Our main question: which of these bagel characteristics is most important to a high-scoring bagel?
